# Le Studio 🗣️ — French Speaking Practice

A single-page React + Tailwind app for practicing intermediate French speaking.
100% client-side — no backend. Your Groq API key lives only in `localStorage`.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # static build in dist/
```

Add a free Groq API key (console.groq.com) via the ⚙️ settings modal — it is
validated against the `/models` endpoint before being stored. Or flip on
**Mock Mode** in settings → Dev Panel to explore the whole app offline.

## Features

- **Roleplay Arena** — scenario-based voice chat (bistro, post office, flight
  rescheduling…) with a surprise curveball on your 3rd turn, 3-step hint
  engine, per-turn corrections, native alternatives, and scores
  (`S = 0.30·grammar + 0.30·naturalness + 0.20·relevance + 0.20·fluency`).
- **Audio engine** — MediaRecorder (webm/mp4-safari), live canvas frequency
  waveform (AnalyserNode), dB peak meter, DynamicsCompressor AGC, and VAD
  auto-submit after 3.5 s of silence.
- **Micro-feedback loop** — Whisper `whisper-large-v3-turbo` transcription
  (editable before sending) → `llama-3.1-8b-instant` strict-JSON evaluation.
- **Session report card** — "Terminer la Session" compiles the conversation
  into a graded report: strengths, stubborn habits, tomorrow's focus, progress
  rings, canvas radar chart, 10-session trend line, streaks, and a shareable
  PNG progress card.
- **Tac au tac** — 45-second improv challenges with WPM flow tracking.
- **Flashcards** — filler-word deck with 3D flip animation, SRS ratings,
  normal + 0.75× slow TTS, and an LLM-verified "use it in a sentence" test.
- **Dev Panel** — token totals, latency pings, raw payload log, Mock Mode.

TTS uses the browser's `speechSynthesis` with the best available `fr-FR`
voice and a 0.5×–1.5× speed slider. Haptics via `navigator.vibrate` on mobile.
